In this repository, I'm sharing my **SQL query notes** that I compiled during my enrollment in the following [DataCamp](https://datacamp.com/) training tracks:

*   **Data Analyst with SQL**
*   **SQL for Business Analysts**
*   **SQL Fundamentals**

The .sql files exclusively consist of example queries (_all credit to_ [_DataCamp_](https://datacamp.com/)_; only minor modifications applied_) to understand script construction, syntax, and more. There's no accompanying data, but feel free to experiment with these statements/functions on your own dataset.
